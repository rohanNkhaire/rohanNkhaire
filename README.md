# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Rohan #

I love to solve problems on a computer. Be it in any field-from general Operating system's errors to a specialized domain in Robotics. I found that my passion lies in Autonomous Systems. On this journey, I have acquired skills pertaining to machine learning, embedded hardware, robotics tools, programming languages, and optimization softwares.

My work entails programming in C++, Python and Matlab/Simulink and extensive use of ROS/ROS2 framework.

My field of Interest lies in providing solutions to problems in Perception, Localization, Planning, and Control of Dynamical Systems.

# Professional Experience #
I am working as a Graduate Service Assistant at [BELIV](https://faculty.engineering.asu.edu/jzhao/) lab at Arizona State University. I am currently spearheading the [Digital Twin and Virtual Reality Project](https://github.com/rohanNkhaire/carla_autoware_bridge) here.



# Projects #

## Framework for Autonomy Stack based on ROS2 ##

### [SimplyAutonomous](https://github.com/rohanNkhaire/SimplyAutonomous) ###
I am implementing my own software stack for autonomous vehicle based on ROS2 and inspired by Autoware.

## Reinforcement learning ##

### [Reinforcement Learning with Active Human Involvement](https://github.com/rohanNkhaire/PVP_CARLA)
I am Implementing a Deep Reinforcement Learning Autonomous Driving agent that takes help from human demostrations to learn.

### [Deep Reinforcement Learning for autonomous vehicle](https://github.com/rohanNkhaire/RL_SB3_carla) ###
I used stable-baselines3 to train an agent to follow a trajectory autonomously using RGB/Semantic sensor as input.

### Deep Learning/Machine Learning ###

### [Driver Monitoring System for Embedded Devices](https://github.com/rohanNkhaire/driver_monitoring_system) ###
I trained a CNN using transfer learning then deployed it on Arduino Nano BLE and Beaglebone Black.

### Planning and Controls ###

### [Motion Planning and Control of Mobile Robots](https://github.com/rohanNkhaire/Motion_Planning_Control_Mobile_Robots)
An implementation of navigation algorithm using two approaches- Map-less and Map to move a mobile robot to a destination.

### [Linear Matrix Inequality solution to Lateral Control](https://github.com/rohanNkhaire/LMI-MPC_lateral_control) ###
An implementation of Linear Matrix Inequality based on Model Predictive Control for an autonomous vehicle to follow a trajectory.

### AR/VR ###

### [Digital Twin and Virtual Reality](https://github.com/rohanNkhaire/carla_autoware_bridge) ###
A Digital Twin of the BELIV lab's autonomous vehicle and virtual reality in the sense that the software stack on real vehicle can respond to the virtual objects in the simulator.

### Misc ###

### [Pick and Place using gazebo Harmonic in Jazzy](https://github.com/rohanNkhaire/ur5_pick_and_place.git)
I created a pick and place environment in Gazebo harmonic with ROS 2. I also created a Gazebo plugin to attach objects to the gripper on contact.

### [Groundtruth Bird-Eye View Maps of CARLA](https://github.com/rohanNkhaire/CARLA_BEV_maps)
Scripts to get groundtruth CARLA town map information (drivable area, sidewalks, crosswalks, etc)

### [A bridge for Carla and Autoware Universe](https://github.com/rohanNkhaire/carla_autoware_bridge) ###
I created a bridge to run simulations with Carla and Autoware Universe.

### [ADAS for class 8 long haul trucks](https://github.com/rohanNkhaire/ADAS_class8_trucks) ###
I ran simulations for crash tests for class 8 trucks according to NHTSA's crash data. Then created ADAS algorithms so that the trucks can avoid collisions.
